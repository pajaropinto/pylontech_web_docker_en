# Pylontech Monitor for Home Assistant

![Pylontech Battery Monitoring](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.1-blue) ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-Compatible-green)

**Pylontech Monitor** is a complete and robust application designed to monitor Pylontech battery systems through an LV-Hub, collecting real-time data and publishing it to an MQTT broker for integration with Home Assistant and other automation platforms.

## 📋 Introduction

This application connects directly either to the **"Console" port of the main battery** or to a **Pylontech LV-Hub** (if installed) via a Serial/TCP/IP interface.  
It retrieves detailed cell-level battery data, processes system-wide and per-battery totals, and publishes all data as JSON over MQTT.

It includes a **built-in web interface** that allows you to:
- View real-time system totals and individual battery data
- Configure system parameters (interface IP, MQTT broker, number of batteries, etc.)
- Access detailed per-cell data for each battery

The application is designed to run continuously in a Docker container, ensuring high availability and easy deployment.

## 🏗️ Architecture and Modules

### 🧠 Core Module (C++)

The heart of the application is written in C++ and performs the following functions:

#### **LV-Hub Connection and Communication**
- Connects to the battery or LV-Hub via TCP/IP
- Sends `stat` commands to retrieve battery cycle counts
- Sends `bat` commands to retrieve detailed cell data
- Implements automatic retries and robust data validation
- Handles configurable delays between readings

#### **Data Processing**
- **Per-battery totals**: Calculates total voltage (sum of cells), average current, average temperature, average SOC, charge/discharge status, alarms, and remaining capacity
- **System totals**: Aggregates data from all batteries (average voltage, total current, average temperature, average SOC, etc.)
- **Data validation**: Filters invalid values, NaN, and out-of-range data
- **Auto-reload**: Reads the configuration file on every cycle to apply changes in real time

#### **MQTT Publishing**
- Publishes raw per-battery data to topics: `homeassistant/pylon/bat01`, `bat02`, ..., `bat15`
- Publishes per-battery totals to: `homeassistant/pylon/total_battery`
- Publishes system totals to: `homeassistant/pylon/total_system`
- Supports MQTT authentication and persistent connection

#### **Built-in Web Server**
- Serves static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Provides REST API for configuration management (`GET /api/config`, `POST /api/config`)
- Includes WebSocket MQTT support for real-time updates

### 🌐 Web Interface

The web interface includes three main tabs:

#### **Tab 1: Totals**
- Shows system totals table (voltage, current, temperature, SOC, status, coulomb, cycles)
- Displays summary table for all batteries
- Visual MQTT connection status indicator (discreet and at the top)

#### **Tab 2: Batteries**
- Shows a detailed table for each battery
- Each table includes all cell data (voltage, current, temperature, SOC, status, coulomb, balance)
- Real-time automatic updates from MQTT

#### **Tab 3: Configuration**
- Centered form with all system parameters
- Labels aligned left, input fields aligned right
- Load and save configuration buttons
- Numeric field validation

```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `app_config.json` file contains the following parameters:

```json
{
    "num_batteries": 15,
    "delay_between_batteries": 1000,
    "delay_between_cycle_battery": 1,
    "battery_tcp_ip": "10.0.0.234",
    "battery_tcp_port": 10034,
    "mqtt_broker_ip": "10.0.0.250",
    "mqtt_broker_port": 1883,
    "mqtt_broker_ws_port": 9001,
    "mqtt_user": "fernan",
    "mqtt_password": "Nabucodonos0_"
}
```

- **`num_batteries`**: Number of batteries to monitor (1-16)
- **`delay_between_batteries`**: Delay between consecutive battery readings (ms)
- **`delay_between_cycle_battery`**: Complete BAT reading cycle duration (minutes)
- **`battery_tcp_ip/port`**: LV-Hub address and port
- **`mqtt_broker_*`**: MQTT broker configuration (including WebSocket port for web interface)

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Download from Docker Hub

The image is publicly available on Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull pajaropinto/pylontech_monitor_es:latest
```

### Run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pylontech_monitor \
  --network host \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  -v $(pwd)/www:/app/www \
  pajaropinto/pylontech_monitor_es:2.1
```

### Docker Compose
```yaml
services:
  pylontech-monitor:
    image: pajaropinto/pylontech_monitor_es:latest
    container_name: pylontech-monitor
    volumes:
      - /main/storage/docker/pylontech_monitor/config:/config
      - /main/storage/docker/pylontech_monitor/log:/log
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
    ports:
      - "61616:61616"
```

### Runtime Parameters

- **`--network host`**: Enables direct access to port 61616 for the web interface
- **`-v config:/app/config`**: Mounts configuration directory for persistence
- **`-v www:/app/www`**: Mounts web files (optional, already included in image)

## 🌐 Web Interface Access

Once running, access the web interface at:

```
http://[SERVER_IP]:61616
```

## 📊 Published MQTT Topics

| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `homeassistant/pylon/bat01` - `bat15` | Raw per-cell data for each battery |
| `homeassistant/pylon/total_battery` | Aggregated per-battery totals |
| `homeassistant/pylon/total_system` | Complete system totals |

## 🔒 Robustness Features

- **Data validation**: Rejects invalid values and retries readings
- **Auto-reload**: Applies configuration changes without restarting
- **Persistent connection**: Automatically reconnects to LV-Hub and MQTT broker
- **No blocking**: Responsive web interface with no freezes
- **Static compilation**: Lightweight Docker image with no external dependencies

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **Battery/LV-Hub connection requirements**: Requires a Serial/TCP interface configured according to application parameters
- **MQTT Broker**: Must have WebSocket enabled on port 9001 for the web interface
- **Home Assistant**: Data integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant MQTT sensors
- **Updates**: Configuration can be modified in real-time from the web interface
